Lost in Translation
===================

This is an experiment to visualize the loss in meaning during translation.

Starts off by generating a randomly ordered list of languages to traverse, starting
and ending in English. Then given a sentence, it translates it from one language to
another, eventually coming back to English. This final output is usually different
from the original; and in some cases hilariously different.

The live demo of this can be found [here](https://lost-in-translation.now.sh/). Deployed
with [now](https://now.sh).

Here is an example run:
